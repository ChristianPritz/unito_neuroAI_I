# unito_neuroAI_I

This repository contains the code from the NeuroAI I lecture of Unito's Computational Neuroscience Course

The Colab notebook showcases how to setup a simple CNN to differentiate faces from other common objects. 
This example uses data from the lfw-dataset (kaggle, jessicali) and CIFAR-10 dataset.
